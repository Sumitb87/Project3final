### Project Overview:
We wanted to create an app specifically for brunch in different neighborhoods in Manhattan. Figuring out a great brunch place is always difficult so we wanted to make searching for brunch an easier process. Neighborhood search and filters should give the user a good understanding of the type of brunch restaurants are offering.

### Process Overview:
We used our own database to append restaurants on the page. We also created a “Add a tip” which will allow users to add a tip to each restaurant. We incorporated a “Directions” which is a directions google api, so the user can just type in their current location and it will give directions to that restaurant. We separated each page into react components so we can easily style, and update each component when needed. We have an “Add a restaurant” which will allow a user to add a restaurant which will autofill an email to be sent out.
We would like to have added a open table widget along with a static map, but didn’t have the time for it. We started with something simple then added on to it. We met twice in the day to go over a time line and agenda which really kept us focused and kept us on track. We are happy with the project overall and would like to add some components as well as some styling.
